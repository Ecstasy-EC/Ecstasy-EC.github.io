2023-03-15	"A Self-rotating, Single-actuated UAV with Extended Sensor Field of View for Autonomous Navigation"	Science Robotics	"Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely heavily on visual sensors to perceive obstacles and explore environments. Current UAVs are limited in both perception capability and task efficiency because of a small sensor field of view (FoV). One solution could be to leverage self-rotation in UAVs to extend the sensor FoV without consuming extra power. This natural mechanism, induced by the counter-torque of the UAV motor, has rarely been exploited by existing autonomous UAVs because of the difficulties in design and control due to highly coupled and nonlinear dynamics and the challenges in navigation brought by the high-rate self-rotation. Here, we present powered-flying ultra-underactuated LiDAR (light detection and ranging) sensing aerial robot (PULSAR), an agile and self-rotating UAV whose three-dimensional position is fully controlled by actuating only one motor to obtain the required thrust and moment. The use of a single actuator effectively reduces the energy loss in powered flights. Consequently, PULSAR consumes 26.7% less power than the benchmarked quadrotor with the same total propeller disk area and avionic payloads while retaining a good level of agility. Augmented by an onboard LiDAR sensor, PULSAR can perform autonomous navigation in unknown environments and detect both static and dynamic obstacles in panoramic views without any external instruments. We report the experiments of PULSAR in environment exploration and multidirectional dynamic obstacle avoidance with the extended FoV via self-rotation, which could lead to increased perception capability, task efficiency, and flight safety."

2022-01-31	FAST-LIO2: Fast Direct Lidar-Inertial Odometry	IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO)	"This article presents FAST-LIO2: a fast, robust, and versatile LiDAR-inertial odometry framework. Building on a highly efficient tightly coupled iterated Kalman filter, FAST-LIO2 has two key novelties that allow fast, robust, and accurate LiDAR navigation (and mapping). The first one is directly registering raw points to the map (and subsequently update the map, i.e., mapping) without extracting features. This enables the exploitation of subtle features in the environment and, hence, increases the accuracy. The elimination of a hand-engineered feature extraction module also makes it naturally adaptable to emerging LiDARs of different scanning patterns; the second main novelty is maintaining a map by an incremental k-dimensional (k-d) tree data structure, incremental k-d tree (ikd-Tree), that enables incremental updates (i.e., point insertion and delete) and dynamic rebalancing. Compared with existing dynamic data structures (octree, R?- tree, and nanoflann k-d tree), ikd-Tree achieves superior overall performance while naturally supports downsampling on the tree. We conduct an exhaustive benchmark comparison in 19 sequences from a variety of open LiDAR datasets. FAST-LIO2 achieves consistently higher accuracy at a much lower computation load than other state-of-the-art LiDAR-inertial navigation systems.Various real-world experiments on solid-state LiDARs with small field of view are also conducted. Overall, FAST-LIO2 is computationally efficient (e.g., up to 100 Hz odometry and mapping in large outdoor environments), robust (e.g., reliable pose estimation in cluttered indoor environments with rotation up to 1000 deg/s), versatile (i.e., applicable to both multiline spinning and solid-state LiDARs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and handheld platforms, and Intel and ARM-based processors), while still achieving a higher accuracy than existing methods. Our implementation of the system FAST-LIO2 and the data structure ikd-Tree are both open-sourced on Github."	"Xu, W., Cai, Y., He, D., Lin, J., & Zhang, F. (2022).

2022-01-10	Robots' State Estimation and Observability Analysis Based on Statistical Motion Models	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology (TCST)	"This article presents a generic motion model to capture mobile robots' dynamic behaviors (translation and rotation). The model is based on statistical models driven by white random processes and is formulated into a full state estimation algorithm based on the error-state extended Kalman filtering framework (ESEKF). The major benefits of this method are its versatility, being applicable to different robotic systems without accurately modeling the robots' specific dynamics, and the ability to estimate the robot's (angular) acceleration, jerk, or higher order dynamic states with low delay. Mathematical analyses with numerical simulations are presented to show the properties of the statistical model-based estimation framework and reveal its connection to existing low-pass filters. Furthermore, a new paradigm is developed for robotic observability analysis by developing Lie derivatives and associated partial differentiation directly on manifolds. It is shown that this new paradigm is much simpler and more natural than existing methods based on quaternion parameterizations. It is also scalable to highdimensional systems. A novel thin set concept is introduced to characterize the unobservable subset of the system states, providing the theoretical foundation to observability analysis of robotic systems operating on manifolds and in high dimension. Finally, extensive experiments, including full state estimation and extrinsic calibration (both POS-IMU and IMU-IMU) on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a handheld platform, and a ground vehicle, are conducted. Comparisons with existing methods show that the proposed method can effectively estimate all extrinsic parameters, the robot's translation/angular acceleration, and other state variables (e.g., position, velocity, and attitude) with high accuracy and low delay."

2022-03-16	"Gemini II: Design, Modeling, and Control of a Compact Yet Efficient Servoless Bi-copter"	IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics (TMECH)	"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are widely used in the field for tasks that require 3-D movements in space. The simultaneous demand for heavy payload capacity, long operating time, and size restriction poses a challenge to UAV design. To solve this conundrum, this article proposes a novel bi-copter with only two actuators. Unlike tandem rotor bi-copters that utilize two servomotors to achieve yaw and roll control, our novel design, the Gemini II bi-copter, controls attitude by using cyclic flapping response in hinges that connect the blades. This passive cyclic pitch-varying mechanism makes the UAV no longer depend on two heavy and expensive servo motors or swashplate to vector the thrust. This change of propulsion system not only makes the UAV mechanically simpler, more reliable, and cost-effective, but also enhances the UAV performance by mitigating the issues of backlash, nonlinearity, and nonminimum phase caused by servo motors. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the Gemini II, built entirely on off-the-shelf electronics, is the first servoless bi-copter that can precisely control its 3-D position and orientation with two actuators only. To demonstrate the flight performance and applications of the proposed novel UAV, we conduct path-following experiments along with manual poking and wind disturbances tests."	"Y. Qin, N. Chen, Y.

2021-08-04	Avoiding Dynamic Small Obstacles with Onboard Sensing and Computation on Aerial Robots	IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)	"In practical applications, autonomous quadrotors are still facing significant challenges, such as the detection and avoidance of very small and even dynamic obstacles (e.g., tree branches, power lines). In this paper, we propose a compact, integrated, and fully autonomous quadrotor system, which can fly safely in cluttered environments while avoiding dynamic small obstacles. Our quadrotor platform is equipped with a forward-looking threedimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (lidar) sensor to perceive the environment and an onboard embedded computer to perform all the estimation, mapping, and planning tasks. Specifically, the computer estimates the current pose of theUAV, maintains a local map (time-accumulated point clouds KD-Trees), and computes a safe trajectory using kinodynamic A* search to the goal point. The whole perception and planning system can run onboard at 50 Hz. Various indoor and outdoor experiments show that the system can avoid dynamic small obstacles (down to 9mmdiameter bar) while flying at 2 m/s in cluttered environments. High-speed experiments are also carried out, with amaximum speed of 5.5 m/s. Our codes are open-sourced on Github."	"F. Kong, W. Xu, Y. Cai and F.

2023-04-03	MARSIM: A light-weight point-realistic simulator for LiDAR-based UAVs	IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)	"The emergence of LiDAR sensors have brought new opportunities for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by advancing navigation safety and computation efficiency. Yet the successful developments of LiDAR-based UAVs must rely on extensive simulations. Existing simulators can hardly perform simulations of real-world environments due to the requirements of dense mesh maps that are difficult to obtain. Therefore, we develop a point-realistic simulator of real-world scenes for LiDAR-based UAVs. The key idea is the underlying point rendering method, where we construct a depth image directly from the point cloud map and interpolate it to obtain realistic LiDAR point measurements. Our developed simulator is able to run on a light-weight computing platform and supports the simulation of LiDARs with different resolution and scanning patterns, dynamic obstacles, and multi-UAV systems. Developed in the ROS framework, the simulator can easily communicate with other key modules of an autonomous robot, such as perception, state estimation, planning, and control. Finally, the simulator provides 10 high-resolution point cloud maps of various real-world environments, including forests of different densities, historic building, office, parking garage, and various complex indoor environments. Evaluation results show that the developed simulator achieves superior performance in terms of time and memory consumption against Gazebo and that the simulated UAV flights highly match the actual one in real-world environments. We believe such a point-realistic and light-weight simulator is crucial to bridge the gap between UAV simulation and experiments and will significantly facilitate the research of LiDAR-based autonomous UAVs in the future."

2021-02-22	ikd-Tree: An Incremental KD Tree for Robotic Applications	Preprint	"This paper proposes an efficient data structure, ikd-Tree, for dynamic space partition. The ikd-Tree incrementally updates a k-d tree with new coming points only, leading to much lower computation time than existing static k-d trees. Besides point-wise operations, the ikd-Tree supports several features such as box-wise operations and down-sampling that are practically useful in robotic applications. In parallel to the incremental operations (i.e., insert, re-insert, and delete), ikd-Tree actively monitors the tree structure and partially rebalances the tree, which enables efficient nearest point search in later stages. The ikd-Tree is carefully engineered and supports multi-thread parallel computing to maximize the overall efficiency. We validate the ikd-Tree in both theory and practical experiments. On theory level, a complete time complexity analysis is presented to prove the high efficiency. On experiment level, the ikd-Tree is tested on both randomized datasets and real-world LiDAR point data in LiDAR-inertial odometry and mapping application. In all tests, ikd-Tree consumes only 4% of the running time in a static k-d tree."	"Cai, Y., Xu, W., & Zhang, F.

2023-09-19	Trajectory Generation and Tracking Control for Aggressive Tail-Sitter Flights	International Journal of Robotics Research	"We address the theoretical and practical problems related to the trajectory generation and tracking control of tail-sitter UAVs. Theoretically, we focus on the differential flatness property with full exploitation of actual UAV aerodynamic models, which lays a foundation for generating dynamically feasible trajectory and achieving high-performance tracking control. We have found that a tail-sitter is differentially flat with accurate (not simplified) aerodynamic models within the entire flight envelope, by specifying coordinate flight condition and choosing the vehicle position as the flat output. This fundamental property allows us to fully exploit the high-fidelity aerodynamic models in the trajectory planning and tracking control to achieve accurate tail-sitter flights. Particularly, an optimization-based trajectory planner for tail-sitters is proposed to design high-quality, smooth trajectories with consideration of kinodynamic constraints, singularity-free constraints, actuator saturation, and obstacle avoidance. The planned trajectory of flat output is transformed to state trajectory in real-time with optional consideration of wind gust. To track the state trajectory, a global, singularity-free, and minimally-parameterized on-manifold MPC is developed, which fully leverages the accurate aerodynamic model to achieve high-accuracy trajectory tracking in the whole flight envelope. The proposed algorithms are implemented on our quadrotor tail-sitter prototype, ``Hong Hu"", and their effectiveness are demonstrated through extensive real-world experiments in both indoor and outdoor field tests, including agile SE(3) flight through consecutive narrow windows (size narrower than the UAV wingspan) with speed up to $10$m/s, typical tail-sitter maneuvers (hovering , transition, level flight and loiter) with speed up to $20$m/s, and extremely aggressive aerobatic maneuvers (Wingover, Loop, Vertical Eight and Cuban Eight) with acceleration up to 2.5g."
