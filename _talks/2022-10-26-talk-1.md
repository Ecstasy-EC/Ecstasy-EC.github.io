In October 2022, I had the privilege of showcasing **FAST-LIO2** in International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2022), Kyoto, Japan. It was my first academic presentation in an international conference. I was truly inspired by the passion from the audience about our work and the insightful questions in the Q&A period. I'm delighted to see that FAST-LIO2 has been gaining increasing interest (and GitHub stars :>) since the conference, contributing to the advancement of LiDAR-inertial Odometry espicially in the aspect of incremental data structures.
