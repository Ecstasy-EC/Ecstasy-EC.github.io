I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate at [Mechatronics and Robotic Systems (MaRS) Laboratory](https://mars.hku.hk/), Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Dr. Fu Zhang](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/Zhang-F) and co-supervised by [Prof. James Lam](https://meweb.hku.hk/jlam/). My recent research mainly focuses on LiDAR-based mapping with applications for robots and autonomous driving. I am deeply interested in exploring elegant representations of the world, which would definitely unlock the boundless possibilities in Robotics!

Previsouly I received my Bachelor's Degree in School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University (formerly known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics) in July, 2020.
