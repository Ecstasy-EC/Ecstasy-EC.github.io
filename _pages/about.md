I am a [Digital Future Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/) in the [Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, collaborating with [Prof. Patric Jensfelt](https://www.kth.se/profile/patric) and [Dr. Olov Andersson](https://www.kth.se/profile/olovand).

Previously I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Robotics at [Mechatronics and Robotic Systems (MaRS) Laboratory](https://mars.hku.hk/) from Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong under the supervision of Prof. Fu Zhang and co-supervised by Prof. James Lam. 
During my PhD journey, I developed [ikd-Tree](https://github.com/hku-mars/ikd-Tree), [FAST-LIO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO), and [D-Map](https://github.com/hku-mars/D-Map) which have been widely used in LiDAR community. 
I received my Bachelor's Degree in School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University (formerly known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics) in 2020. 

My research mainly focuses on LiDAR-based mapping with applications on Robotics. I am deeply interested in exploring elegant representations of the world, which would definitely unlock the boundless possibilities in Robotics.
