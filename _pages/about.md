I am a recent PhD graduate from [Mechatronics and Robotic Systems (MaRS) Laboratory](https://mars.hku.hk/), Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Dr. Fu Zhang](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/Zhang-F) and co-supervised by [Prof. James Lam](https://meweb.hku.hk/jlam/). Previously I received my Bachelor's Degree in School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University (formerly known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics) in 2020. 

My research mainly focuses on LiDAR-based mapping with applications on Robotics. I am deeply interested in exploring elegant representations of the world, which would definitely unlock the boundless possibilities in Robotics.

I will soon join KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm as a [Digital Future Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/), collaborating with [Prof. Patric Jensfelt](https://www.kth.se/profile/patric) and [Dr. Olov Andersson](https://www.kth.se/profile/olovand) in the [Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl).
