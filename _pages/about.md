I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate at [Mechatronics and Robotic Systems (MaRS) Laboratory](https://mars.hku.hk/), Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Dr. Fu Zhang](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/Zhang-F) and co-supervised by [Prof. James Lam](https://meweb.hku.hk/jlam/). My recent research mainly focuses on LiDAR-based mapping with applications on Robotics. I am deeply interested in exploring elegant representations of the world, which would definitely unlock the boundless possibilities in Robotics. Previsouly I received my Bachelor's Degree in School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University (formerly known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics) in July, 2020. 

**I am currently seeking a postdoctoral position** to further my journey in the field of LiDAR mapping or any related research. I warmly welcome any opportunity in this domain and would be delighted to discuss potential collaborations. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in exploring my research further.
