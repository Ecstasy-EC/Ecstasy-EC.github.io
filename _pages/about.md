I am a third-year Ph.D. Canditate at [Mechatronics and Robotic Systems (MaRS) Laboratory](https://mars.hku.hk/), Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Dr. Fu Zhang](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/Zhang-F) and co-supervised by [Prof. James Lam](https://meweb.hku.hk/jlam/). My research mainly focus on LiDAR-based mapping on Robotics and autonomous driving.

Previsouly I received my Bachelor's Degree in School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University(BUAA) in July, 2020.
