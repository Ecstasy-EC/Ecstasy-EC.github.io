## Abstract

Mobile robots have revolutionized various fields, offering solutions for manipulation, environmental monitoring, and exploration. However, payload capacity remains a limitation. This article presents a novel thrust-based robotic hopper capable of carrying payloads up to nine times its own weight while maintaining agile mobility over less structured terrain. The 220 g robot carries upto 2 kg while hopping—–a capability that bridges the gap between high-payload ground robots and agile aerial platforms. Key advancements that enable this high-payload capacity include the integration of bidirectional thrusters, allowing for both upward and downward thrust generation to enhance energy management while hopping. In addition, we present a refined model of dynamics that accounts for heavy payload conditions, particularly for large jumps. To address the increased computational demands, we employ a neural network compression technique, ensuring real-time onboard control. The robot’s capabilities are demonstrated through a series of experiments, including leaping over a high obstacle, executing sharp turns with large steps, as well as performing simple autonomous navigation while carrying a 730 g LiDAR payload. This showcases the robot’s potential for applications, such as mobile sensing and mapping, in challenging environments.
