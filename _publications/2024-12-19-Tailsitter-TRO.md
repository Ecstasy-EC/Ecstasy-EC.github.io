## Abstract

Trajectory generation for fully autonomous flights of tail-sitter unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents substantial challenges due to their highly nonlinear aerodynamics. In this paper, we introduce, to the best of our knowledge, the world&apos;s first fully autonomous tail-sitter UAV capable of high-speed navigation in unknown, cluttered environments. The UAV autonomy is enabled by cutting-edge technologies including LiDAR-based sensing, differential-flatness-based trajectory planning and control with purely onboard computation. In particular, we propose an optimization-based tail-sitter trajectory planning framework that generates high-speed, collision-free, and dynamically-feasible trajectories. To efficiently and reliably solve this nonlinear, constrained 	extcolor{black}{problem}, we develop an efficient feasibility-assured solver, EFOPT, tailored for the online planning of tail-sitter UAVs. We conduct extensive simulation studies to benchmark EFOPT&apos;s superiority in planning tasks against conventional NLP solvers. We also demonstrate exhaustive experiments of aggressive autonomous flights with speeds up to 15m/s in various real-world environments, including indoor laboratories, underground parking lots, and outdoor parks.
