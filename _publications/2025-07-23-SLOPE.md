## Abstract

Landslides pose significant threats to residents’ safety and daily lives. To mitigate such risks, flexible debris-resisting barriers are constructed and regularly inspected, a task known as slope inspection. Traditional manual inspections are costly and difficult due to steep terrains and dense vegetation. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with LiDAR and cameras offers high mobility, making them well-suited for slope inspections. However, existing UAV solutions lack comprehensive frameworks to handle dense vegetation, including robust localization, high-precision mapping, small and dynamic obstacle avoidance, and cluttered under-canopy navigation. To address these challenges, we develop a LiDAR-based quadrotor with a comprehensive software system. Our quadrotor features assisted obstacle avoidance, enabling it to autonomously avoid intricate obstacles while executing pilot commands. Field experiments conducted in collaboration with the Hong Kong Civil Engineering and Development Department demonstrate our quadrotor’s ability to avoid small obstacles and maneuver in dense vegetation, validating its practical potential for slope inspection.
